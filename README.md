# PasswordGenerator

This project is built so that it creats a password generator.

The problem for this project was given so that we can practice on how to write functions, passing arguments, and returning values. 

The Website meets the requirement and it works, you can see it generate a password based on the user's choice. 

In the Javascript file I created a promt function and a generatepassword function so that it works fully. 

One of the things I have learned while doing this is that I would have to return a vlue at the end, for example I am returning a vlue at the end of my for loop in my generatepassword function, I initially forgot to do that and my website wasn't generating a password. Also learned how to pass in variables into functions and how to use them.
